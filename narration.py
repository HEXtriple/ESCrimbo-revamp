#introduction
intro_txt1 = '''
You wake up in the middle of a street, surrounded by dilapidated buildings and rubbish. 
After looking around you realize that the area is completely empty. 
The rain weighs down on your shoulders and it grows heavier with every second that passes. 
You take a few steps forward and notice a sign that reads "Rimbo Bus Station". 
The words make you fall to your knees, and you realize that you are in the middle of Sweden's 
most dangerous city. You build up the courage to stand back up. The only path is forward.
'''

intro_txt2 = '''
You notice a monitor below the sign, it displays the timetable for bus arrivals. 
The only trip is to Norrtälje, and the time of departure is suspiciously missing. 
Apart from that you see a dark alley and a rickety bridge. You have to choose between 
a bus that may never arrive, a mysterious dark alley and a rickety bridge. What will you do?
'''


#Route 1 - "Wait for the bus"

You decide to wait for the bus. You stand there in the cold for hours on end, 
until you see a pair of headlights in the distance. A bus approaches and a group 
of rogue goblins hop out. They run towards you and a fight breaks out.
'''

r1_txt2 = '''
You won the battle and the goblins befriend you out of respect, they offer to take you to their leader, 
you agree to follow them. You arrive at their hideout and are met with a strange man named Fulcrum.
He takes a sip from his vape and offers an alliance. Before you get to speak to him any further a 
group of bandits storm into the room. You have three choices. You can fight for the bandits, 
take the side of Fulcrum or escape, what will you do?
'''


#Route 2 - "The Dark Alley"

You enter the alley, and find a suspicious wardrobe. 
Your curiosity makes you want to open it, but it might be dangerous. 
'''

You open it, only to find a strange man with glasses and a bowl cut. 
He jumps out at you and a fight begins.
'''

You ignore the wardrobe, and proceed forward through the alley. 
Not getting any items and feeling depressed.
'''

When you get out of the alley you're greeted with a large wooden house. 
You get a little closer but a group of goblins storm you before there is a chance to react. 
A fight begins.
'''

r2_txt4 = '''
You beat the goblins and enter the house. You're greeted by a strange man who sits on a throne. 
He takes a sip from his vape before introducing himself to you. He says that his name is Fulcrum and 
that he's the leader of the goblins. He offers a treaty of peace but a group of bandits storm into 
the room before you get to speak any further. You're gravely outnumbered, will you fight for the 
bandits or alongside Fulcrum?
'''


#Route 3 - "Go Beyond the Rickety Bridge"
r3_txt1 = '''You go towards the rickety bridge and get approached by a massive muscular testosterone-
fueled man. He presents himself as Martin Loman, first of his name, king of the andals and the rhoynar 
and the first men, lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm. He gets extremely close 
to you and whispers in your ear "don't go beyond the rickety bridge" before disappearing without a trace. 
Will you still continue?'''

direction. You realize that it isn't an ordinary man, it's Pangloss from the hit new york time's 
best seller candide, written by Voltaire. He swings his arms towards you in a wild manner, and a 
fight breaks out.
